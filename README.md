### Description

This is COMPUTERIZED SCHOOL REGISTRATION SYSTEM. It accepts new enrollees, accepts payments and generate reports. I used Access for my database, ODBC and Excel for the reports. This system will monitor the payments of each student from their first payments to their balance. I include brief personal info of the teacher because that is needed in sectioning. The original plan is to automatically assign the students to a certain section based on their general average but the school change their sectioning system. I'm currently working on this project, comments and suggestions are very much welcom.
